Logistic Regression and a single layer neural network for the Kaggle Titanic Competition for MTLData - Oct.-22,2014

This IPython notebook is a continuation of [work (IPython-NB Link)] (http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/aanchan/Titanic-MTLDATA/blob/master/TitanicPythonIntro.ipynb) from our previous meetup for the Kaggle Titanic Competition. The solution presented there was using Pandas+SciKit Learn. [Click here](https://github.com/aanchan/Titanic-MTLDATA) for the Github page for that meetup.
